1.	Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.

	.forEach() takes a function and iterates through each array instance, returning the answers individually.

	.map() takes a function and iterates through an array but returns an array with the answers.

2.	What is the difference between a function and a method?

	Methods are specific to and object while arrays are not.

3.	What is closure?

	Closure is when an inner function has access to not only the variables within its own scope but also outer variables as well as global variables. Outer functions however cannot access inner variables.

4.	Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

	1.	Window Object binding – returns the global object, window.
	2.	Implicit Binding – called with a preceding dot refers to an instance of object
	3.	New binding – when using the ‘new’ key word and a constructor function is used.
	4.	Explicit binding – when call() or apply() is used.

5.	Why do we need super() in an extended class?

	Used to bind classes together. Gives access and calls functions on an objects parent.
